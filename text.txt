The keyword extraction process helps us in identifying the important words. It also effective in topic modeling tasks. You can know a lot about your text data by only a few keywords. These keywords will help you to determine whether you want to read an article or not.

In this article, I have explained 4 python libraries (spaCy, YAKE, rake-nltk, Gensim) that fetch the keywords from the article or text data. You can also search for other python libraries for a similar task.

Hopefully, this article will help you with your NLP tasks.
