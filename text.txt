I was unable to get a request working using application/octet-stream type posts, but have used multipart/form-data type forms in the past to upload images using flask.

I have extended what I have done in the past to support multiple upload files and this has worked leveraging werkzeug's FileStorage objects.

The key here is setting up a post based route that is looking for a request element from a form. This should allow you to POST to the route either via a standard form or an AJAX call.
